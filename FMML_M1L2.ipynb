There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "Cons:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduced Training Data: A larger validation set means less data is available for training the model. This can lead to a decrease in training accuracy, especially with limited datasets.\n",

        "In Summary\n",

        "The optimal validation set percentage depends on the specific dataset and the complexity of the model. A common approach is to use a validation set that is 20-30% of the total dataset size.

        "Enough data for training: 80% for training usually provides a sufficient amount of data for the model to learn effectively.\n",

        "Dataset size: For smaller datasets, you might want to increase the validation set size slightly to get a more reliable estimate.\n",
        "Model complexity: More complex models might benefit from a slightly larger validation set to help prevent overfitting.\n",
